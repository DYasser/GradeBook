# GradeBook

Grade book that shows all valuable information needed plus a graph showing which grades are more common than others.

## How to run

To get started you can `git clone  https://github.com/DYasser/GradeBook.git` and have `Java` installed and initialized. You can run the file then by running the main class using an IDE.

## Objectif

This algorithm allows the user to get lots of information about a class by only inputing grades inside. After getting all the information, it is changing it into a graph format too to make it look easier for the user and help him understand the data better.
